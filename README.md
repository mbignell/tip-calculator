How many hours did it take to complete?

About an hour for the very base version, then perhaps another hour to get it to proper styling with the segmented control and base functionality.

I then decided to allow more flexibility with a stepper instead of a segmented control, and allow for bill splitting, adding about three hours of work because I kept breaking things with commas and typos and that was a blast. ;)

Update 8/13: probably about another 3 to get the modal working without breaking the app, and miscelaneous other updates/enhacements.

Which required and optional stories have you completed?

Required:
-Tip calculator that...calculates tips

Optional (incl large and small for clarity):
–Immediate activation of keyboard so user doesn't have to tap into field
–UI stepper for more flexibility
–Bill splitting
–App icon
–Update 8/12: added animation to initial interaction
–Update 8/12: added fake settings page — as in, the segmented controls are not (yet) hooked up to anything, but the modal is functional
–Update 8/12: There's a money bag emoji that links to a gif because I was curious how that worked, too, so why not?
–Update 8/13: Launch image, finally! ~silly coding mistakes~

Continuing to work on adding:
—$ prefix on bill entering
–Settings/currency -> functional
–Might address some usability concerns of the associations between stepper and tip, but prioritizing cool coding things ;)

Of note: apologies for the horrible name. I've tried to change it as per the internet's instructions, and I just break it—wanted to prioritize features v name.
