<i>How many hours did it take to complete?</i>

About an hour for the very base version, then perhaps another hour to get it to proper styling with the segmented control and base functionality.

I then decided to allow more flexibility with a stepper instead of a segmented control, and allow for bill splitting, adding about three hours of work because I kept breaking things with commas and typos and that was a blast. ;)

Update 8/13: probably about another 3 to get the modal working without breaking the app, and miscelaneous other updates/enhacements.

<i>Which required and optional stories have you completed?</i>

Required:
<ul><li>Tip calculator that...calculates tips</li></ul>

Optional (incl large and small for clarity):
<ul><li>Immediate activation of keyboard so user doesn't have to tap into field</li>
<li>UI stepper for more flexibility</li>
<li>Bill splitting</li>
<li>App icon</li>
<li>8/12: added animation to initial interaction</li>
<li>8/12: added fake settings page — as in, the segmented controls are not (yet) hooked up to anything, but the modal is functional</li>
<li>8/12: There's a money bag emoji that links to a gif because I was curious how that worked, too, so why not?</li>
<li>8/13: Launch image, finally! ~silly coding mistakes~</li>
<li>8/14: Added some logic so the modal option is "Close" until a change is made, at which point it changes color and text to "Save"</li>
<li>8/14: Hacked in so the $ shows in the text field when the user is editing! It's ghetto fab but it works.</li>

Continuing to work on adding:
<li>Settings/currency -> functional</li>
</ul>

Of note: apologies for the horrible name. I've tried to change it as per the internet's instructions, and I just break it—wanted to prioritize features v name.
