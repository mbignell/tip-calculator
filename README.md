# tip-calculator
Worst file names ever, my bad. Changing them is breaking it, choosing to prioritize work over name. :| Tip calculator pre work for codepath!

Note / [sending an email as well]

I'm actually heading out of the country for a vacation for three weeks August 19 - Sept 8. Would absolutely love to still interview if possible, but it may be hard to coordinate (not sure about internet connectivity in Sri Lanka, absolutely willing to try and make it work!). If it can't work, no worriesâ€”I'll apply to the next codepath session, but again, would absolutely *love* to be able to participate in this one as I know I'll be totally free for the duration of the course. Sorry for the short notice! 

(Because of this, I wanted to submit as soon as I got it to a reasonable state. Still working on additional features for fun!)

How many hours did it take to complete?

About an hour for the very base version, then perhaps another hour to get it to proper styling with the segmented control and base functionality.

I then decided to allow more flexibility with a stepper instead of a segmented control, and allow for bill splitting, adding about three hours of work because I kept breaking things with commas and typos and that was a blast. ;)

Which required and optional stories have you completed?

Required:
<ul><li>Tip calculator that...calculates tips?</li></ul>

Optional (incl large and small for clarity):
<ul>
<li>Immediate activation of keyboard so user doesn't have to tap into field</li>
<li>UI stepper for more flexibility</li>
<li>Bill splitting</li>
<li>App icon</li>
</ul>

Continuing to work on adding:
<ul><li>Figuring out the proper launch image</li>
<li>$ prefix on bill entering</li>
<li>Settings/currency</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Might address some usability concerns of the associations between stepper and tip, but prioritizing cool coding things ;)</li>
</ul>
